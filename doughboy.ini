# CDHW method
# set pid = (x 0 0) where x is point at which system starts oscilating
# then reduce the gain by 30% and note the oscilating period
# d ~ 1/3 of the period
# slowly increase I until oscillation just starts, then reduce by factor of 2 or 3
# modified Z-N - John Shaw's method
# set pid = (x 0 0) and get ultimate gain and period
# then pid = (0.6Ku  2/Tu  Tu/8)
# with Ku=4 and Tu=20min, pid = (2.4  .001667  150)
# with Ku=20 and Tu=23min, pid = (2.4  .001667  150)
